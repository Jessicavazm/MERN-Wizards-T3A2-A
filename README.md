##Description:

A discussion board to allow staff or group members to discuss and set workflow priorities. Registered users and user classification will manage how users can interact, delete or archive threads. 

## Purpose:
**Easy collaboration:** An economic and efficient way for business to communicate and plan future workflow priorities.  
**Reduces subscription costs:** Increase the level of staff collaboration without the cost of increasing user subscriptions. 
**Reduce invalid service requests:** Reduce the number of invalid tickets being created by staff that are unsure which unit manages the asset or project in question.

## Functionality/features:

The discussion board will allow for an informal conversation across the business to map and prioritise workflow for the 12-month plan and allow priorities to pivot to accommodate work that may impact the planned deliverables.
